== Welcome to Clubcar

Clubcar arose out of a group of co-workers pathological inability to choose a
lunch destination. We tried a few automated solutions, but these were little
more than a random number generator tied to a(n occasionally weighted) list of
restaurants.

== Features

There are plenty of solutions out there, here's what makes Clubcar different:

1. Genres. Organize restaurants by genre.

2. History. Clubcar can remember where you've been, and only recommend
   restaurants in genres you haven't had recently.

3. Preferences. Restaurant choices are weighted by the preferences of the
   users coming to lunch that day.

4. Moods. It can be a hassle to manage sets of restaurant preferences
   individually. Instead, set them in sets and simply ask "what am I in the 
   mood for?"
   
5. Email alerts and prompts to remind everyone to register preferences & 
   presence.

== Caveat

This is a weekend-noodling project. There's only a bare minimum here to get it
working well enough for 6 of us. You're welcome to use it as is, or help us
flesh out the functionality.
