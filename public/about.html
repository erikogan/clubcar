    <h1>About Clubcar</h1>

    <p>
      Welcome to Clubcar, our new, <a
      href="http://www.rubyonrails.org/">Rails</a>-based, lunchtime
      cat-herder.
    </p>

    <p>A few notes up front:</p>

    <ol>
      <li>
	This document is almost gauranteed to be out of date as soon as
	it is finished being written. If something dosen't match the
	documentation, believe the application, not the docs.
      </li>

      <li>
	The applications creates pages that are 100% compliant XHTML
	(1.0 Strict), with very simple CSS and a minimum of Javascript. 
	I mention this mostly because IE seems to render a few of the
	pages as blank. If this were a production application I would
	track down the problem, however it isn't. So if you use IE and
	have problems, <strong>get a real %#$@$ing browser.</strong>
      </li>

      <li>
	This is just a quick set of hints to get you up and running, and
	is not intended as a substitute for real documentation (of which
	there is none), or common sense (of which there seems to be a
	vanishing supply in the world).
      </li>
    </ol>
